# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

re2c:
re2c: re2c is a tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners.
re2c: re2c focuses on generating high efficient code for regular expression
re2c: matching. As a result this allows a much broader range of use than any
re2c: traditional lexer offers. And last but not least, re2c generates
re2c: warning free code that is equal to hand written code in terms of size,
re2c: speed and quality.
